# Event-Driven Data Processing and Automated Reporting Pipeline on AWS

## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **fully automated, event-driven data processing pipeline on AWS**.  
The system captures incoming data, processes it automatically, stores it for analysis, and generates **daily summary reports** with **email notifications**.

The entire infrastructure is provisioned using **Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)** and deployed automatically using **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**.

This project is built as part of a cloud/devops assignment to showcase real-world AWS architecture, automation, and monitoring practices.
